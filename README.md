# PROJECT 1 DSF-FT3
# MICROSOFT CASE STUDY
# BELLA SOMWE
# INTRODUCTION
In this project expectations are to explore what types of films are currently doing 
the best at the box office, translate those findings into actionable insights that the 
head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to 
create.
## OBJECTIVES
● Extract data from the datasets provided
● Analyze extracted data carefully and accurately
● Generate visualizations of the analysis
● Come up with recommendations upon interpreting visualizations.
## DESCRIBING THE TARGET AUDIENCE
The target is the head of the new Microsoft movie studio. It is unknown whether 
the target has technical background so it is best to assume he/she does not. The 
goal of this presentation is to clearly communicate the findings of the data.
## BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want 
to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they 
don’t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what 
types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then 
translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new 
movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.
## DATA UNDERSTANDING
The data sources for this analysis will be pulled from files in the data folder
The folder contains:
● Im.db: A sqlite database 
● Bom.movies.csv: A csv file containing movies alongside domestic and foreign 
gross profit
● tmdb.movies.csv : A csv file containing movies with emphasis on movie 
popularity.
● Tn.movie_budgets.csv: A csv file containing movies alongside their budgets.
## PROCESS STEPS
1. Extracting the data from the various formats using appropriate packages ie 
csv and sqlite3.
2. Inspect and preview the data.
3. Change the data to a DataFrame.
4. Check for missing values.
5. Handle missing values if any.
6. Analyze the dataframes.
7. Plot barcharts in accordance to analysis.
8. Generate recommendations.
## RESULTS
STUDIOS WITH MOST MOVIES
TOP MOVIE RATINGS TYPES
TOP 5 RATED GENRES
## RECOMMENDATIONS
- Microsoft studio should create documentaries as they are the majority in the market with the highest 
rating and would be a good starting point.
- On the long term however, Microsoft studio should focus on action,adventure,sci-fi as it is clearly the 
most voted meaning alot of people like this kind of content. This means coming up with own superheroes 
and promoting them as films such as Avatar have the biggest worldwide gross which means alot of profit 
but at the same time films such as this also have big budgets, so it must be carefully planned.
- Microsoft should also try to partner with the top studios with the most movies such as IFC, Uni and WB. 
This will help you grasp information about the film industry and provide a good cache of knowlegde.
- Microsoft should also focus on movies with ratings type G as they will be viewed by all people and have 
little saturation in the market hence a low on competition. This is due to the fact that majority of viewers of 
action,adventure,sci fi genre can be assumed to be school children.
## CONCLUSION
● The movies with the highest budget have the highest gross profit worldwide.
● The movies with the highest rating are not necessarily the ones with the most 
number of votes.
● Most of the movies produced are rated restricted meaning most of the movies 
are adult movies.
